                <p class="text-center"><strong>Human Ingenuity in an AI-Driven World</strong>
                
                <p>“Can we survive technology?” John von Neumann asked this question in 1955 in Fortune magazine. Today, as artificial intelligence enters a new phase of rapid development, it is more relevant than ever. AI is transforming education, research, and labor markets worldwide, posing challenges across society. As AI appears to devalue hard work and fundamental knowledge, not only the sciences but also the arts face profound disruption. The new technology increasingly reshapes - and threatens to replace - scientists, teachers, and artists.

These developments are deeply connected to von Neumann’s revolutionary contributions to computing, game theory, and scientific reasoning, which demonstrate how abstract theory can drive rapid and far-reaching societal change. Echoing von Neumann’s enduring insight, the conference argues that human survival depends on advancing wisdom, ethics, methods, and governance at the same pace as technological power.

Building on the 2023–2025 editions, the Neumann Series has never been a historical or biographical event, but rather a unique forum integrating basic research and applied science while addressing emerging challenges from multiple perspectives. Its guiding conviction is that technological breakthroughs do not mark the end of history, but instead signal new beginnings.

By bringing together students, early-career researchers, and senior scholars across disciplines, the Neumann Series fosters interdisciplinary exchange and a vision of innovation grounded in responsibility, creativity, and human values - reflecting the belief that we are not at the end of creativity and thought, but at the threshold of a bold new era. This is the dialogue we seek to start - a conversation about embracing technology without surrendering the ingenuity that defines humanity.</p>

In 1989, at the age of just 12, she topped the adult women’s world rankings, a position she held for 26 years. At the age of 14, she was a two-time Olympic team champion in women's chess (1988, 1990) and later won two silver medals as a member of the Hungarian men’s team (2002, 2014). In 2005, she fought for the men’s world title in San Luis. She has defeated eleven world champions in classical, rapid or blitz games. Since her retirement in 2014, she has been involved in the international promotion of chess through the World Chess Festival, which is organized by the foundation that bears her name. She is the author of books, has developed the Judit Polgár Method (ChessPlayground, ChessPalace, ChessPE program) involving experts and teachers to teach chess to pre-school and school-age children, and frequently holds seminars and TED Talks. Polgár is an ambassador for UN WOMEN’s „Planet 50-50 Champion" gender equality program,” which promotes the proportional participation of women in society and the elimination of gender stereotypes. She is also an expert commentator for major international competitions.</p>

He was a fellow at the Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in Budapest and from 1986 Professor of Computer Science at Rutgers University. Many of his discoveries bear his name. One of the most important is the Szemerédi theorem, which proves a conjecture made by Erdős and Paul Turán in 1936. It shows that there are arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions in any set of integers with positive density. An important step in this proof, now known as Szemerédi's Regularity Lemma, is a structural classification of large graphs. His work also found many applications in computer science, especially his collaboration with computer scientist Miklós Ajtai and mathematician János Komlós on sorting. In 1983, the trio developed the Ajtai-Komlós-Szemerédi (AKS) sorting network, an algorithm that sorts n objects in a certain order in log n time steps, i.e. in the theoretically shortest possible time.</p>

                    <p>Thirty years ago, in 1994, two Hungarian-born scientists received their Nobel Prizes in the United States.
                        John C. Harsanyi received the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on game theory and its application to economics. He showed how games with incomplete information can be analyzed and thus provided the theoretical basis for a vibrant field of research – information economics. He is also known for his research on utilitarian ethics and is considered one of the most important representatives of “rule utilitarianism”.
                        George Andrew Olah was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his contribution to carbocation chemistry. Chemical reactions in which molecules of atoms collide and form new compounds are among the fundamental processes of nature. Carbocations are electrically charged molecules in which the charge is concentrated on a carbon atom. They play an important role as intermediates in chemical reactions and have a very short lifespan. In the early 1960s, George Olah used very strong acids to generate carbocations in solution with lifetimes long enough to study them
                        With this conference and the side events we would like to honor their achievements and provide information about their work and scientific legacy on this page.

                <h2>The story of Rubik's Cube</h2>
                    <p>The Rubik's Cube, invented by Ernő Rubik in 1974 - exactly 50 years ago -, is much more than just a popular puzzle; it has great significance in various fields, from education to cognitive science and beyond.
            
                        The Rubik's Cube is a complex puzzle that requires strategic thinking and problem solving. To solve it, one must understand and apply algorithms, which promotes cognitive skills such as pattern recognition, spatial reasoning and logical thinking. These skills are transferable to other school and real-world challenges.
                        
                        The structure of the cube and the algorithms used to solve it are deeply rooted in mathematical concepts, including group theory and combinatorics. Memorizing the sequences and algorithms required to solve the cube can improve memory and recall. This memory exercise can be beneficial for students and professionals who need to memorize and apply complex information.
                        
                        The Rubik's Cube became a worldwide phenomenon shortly after its invention, spawning competitions, clubs and a vibrant community of enthusiasts. Many educators use the Rubik's Cube as a teaching tool to make learning more engaging. It can be used to teach math concepts, problem solving strategies and even history by exploring the origin of the cube and its influence on pop culture.

                    <h4>Rubik`s Cube in popular culture</h4>
                    <p>What do James Bond, The Big Bang Theory, Despicable Me, Pursuit of Happines, Spidermen, Family Guy, Snowden, Wall-E, The Simpsons or the Spice Girls, Harry Styles, Dua Lipa, Jennifer Lopez, Marooon 5, Genesis, Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran have in common? Yes, all of these movies and musicians have used the Rubik`s Cube in one way or another. Whether used as a tool to enhance character empathy, as a background prop or as a symbol of intelligence, the Rubik's Cube is a versatile and iconic element. Its presence in films and music often emphasizes themes of mental agility and problem solving, using its universal recognition value to appeal to audiences and convey deeper messages.
