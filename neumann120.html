                <p>John von Neumann is probably the most impactful Hungarian-born scientist in the United States. He was one of the founding professors of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton along with Albert Einstein and Oswald Veblen. In 1999, he was named "Person of the Century'' by the Financial Times. He was part of the group of Hungarian scholars referred to as "Martians'' who found a new and welcome home in the United States during the dark period in Europe before and after World War II. This group included Paul Erd≈ës, Paul Halmos, Theodore von K√°rm√°n, John G. Kemeny, John von Neumann, George P√≥lya, Leo Szilard, Edward Teller, Eugene Wigner, Franz Alexander, Peter Carl Goldmark, John Harsanyi, Peter Lax, George Olah, Egon Orowan, John Polanyi, Valentine Telegdi, Cornelius Lanczos, many of theme either won Nobel prize, or invented something unique and contributed to the advancement of all humanity. 


                    Von Neumann was born 120 years ago in 1903, and we have chosen to celebrate this anniversary with several events honoring his legacy and contributions to science and innovation in the United States and around the world. Von Neumann undertook to solve the most difficult challenges by working in parallel on the most abstract and practical aspects of the problem, in an interdisciplinary approach within mathematics, across sciences and cultures. Specific cross-connections between science and practice include digital computing, game theory, general equilibrium, artificial intelligence, and many other areas based on his earlier research. A number of Nobel laureates have learned and used many of Neumann's theories in the fields of economics, mathematics, chemistry, and physics.
                    
                    
                    To celebrate the 120th anniversary of Neumann‚Äôs birth, several organizations in Hungary are preparing a series of commemorative events to make Neumann's legacy as accessible as possible. The lead institution in organizing these events is the Janos Neumann Computer Society. In close collaboration with it and many other experts in theoretical and applied sciences, the Science and Innovation Section of the Consulate General of Hungary is committed to promoting Neumann's scientific legacy in every possible forum. Thanks to the close cooperation with many stakeholders, there will be conferences, exhibitions, cultural and educational programs in New York, Philadelphia and many other cities in the United States in the fall of 2023 and spring of 2024.</p>

His awards include the Camille Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Award, AFOSR Young Investigator Award, DOE Early Career Award, Young Innovator Award in NanoEnergy, and Journal of Physical Chemistry/PHYS Division Lectureship. He serves as principal investigator of the NSF National eXtreme Ultrafast Science (NeXUS) facility. His research focuses on the critical role that surface electron dynamics have on the selectivity and efficiency of catalytic energy conversion processes. Toward this goal his group has developed femtosecond soft x-ray reflection-absorption spectroscopy as a surface sensitive probe of ultrafast electron dynamics. In 2022-2023 he was a recipient of the Fulbright John Von Neumann Distinguished Award in STEM to Hungary.</p>

His main focus is ‚Äúneural syntax‚Äù, i.e., how segmentation of neural information is organized by the numerous brain rhythms to support cognitive functions. He pioneered the experimental exploration of rhythmic neuronal activity and defined synaptic-cellular mechanisms of hippocampal sharp waves, theta and gamma oscillations. His theories and innovative methods have turned studies on brain rhythms into one of the most active research areas of circuit and cognitive neuroscience and assisting diagnosis of mental disease and drug discovery. He is among the top 0.1% most-cited neuroscientists, member of the National Academy of Sciences USA, Academia Europaea, Fellow of AAAS, and he sits on the editorial boards of several leading neuroscience journals, including Science and Neuron, honoris causa at Universit√© Aix-Marseille, France, University of Pecs and University of Kaposvar, Hungary. He is a co-recipient of the 2011 Brain Prize. (Books: Rhythms of the Brain, OUP, 2006; The Brain from Inside Out, OUP 2019).</p>

He spent two years at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland with a Marie Curie Individual Fellowship, where he studied Hawking radiation in laboratory analogues, e.g. in Bose-Einstein condensed cold atomic gases. In recent years, his research has been focused on quantum walks and the effect of quantum measurements on the dynamics of systems in quantum information. He has worked out various aspects of the theory of measurement-induced, iterated, nonlinear quantum protocols.</p>

                            <p>
                                Professor Lax began his career in the United States, working at Los Alamos for the Manhattan Project under the direction of John von Neumann. Between 1972 and 1980, he was director of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, one of the most important research centers for pure and applied mathematics. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He was both president (1977-80) and vice president (1969-71) of the American Mathematical Society. In 2005, Lax was honored with the highest award in mathematics, the prestigious Abel Prize "for his pioneering contributions to the theory and application of partial differential equations and to the computation of their solutions".
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In addition to his outstanding scientific work, Professor Lax was always a great advocate of preserving the scientific legacy of John von Neumann. He always believed that von Neumann should be known in much broader circles because his contributions to physics, mathematics, neuroscience, economics, computer science, and other fields have given impetus to the development of these fields far beyond his lifetime. Peter has organized high-profile events dedicated to the work of John von Neumann over the past several decades and has spoken about his work on dozens of occasions in the United States and Hungary.
