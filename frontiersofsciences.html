                    <span class="event-location">Temple University, Philadelphia</span>
                </p>
                <p>Philadelphia is a major center of science and has a rich history of scientific innovation and cutting-edge research. It is home to renowned universities and research institutions, including the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), Drexel University, Thomas Jefferson University, Temple University and many others. These institutions are driving cutting-edge research in "frontier science", i.e. the exploration and investigation of scientific areas that lie at the edge of current knowledge and understanding. Nothing proves this more than the fact that two outstanding scientists working and living in Philadelphia, Katalin Kariko and Drew Weismann, have jointly been awarded the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries on nucleoside base modifications that have enabled the development of effective mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) vaccines against COVID-19. Katalin Karikó is affiliated to the Szeged University, Hungary and University of Pennsylvania. Drew Weissman is affiliated to the Penn Institute for RNA Innovations University of Pennsylvania.</p>
                <p>The city is well poised to be one of the leading centers for frontier research, testing and fleshing out scientific ideas that are relatively new and not yet supported by years of scientific evidence. Pioneering research takes place at the frontiers of knowledge in a particular field. To name just a few scientific areas where we can expect such breakthroughs, leading to uncharted territories and unimaginable prospects, are the following.
                </p>
                <strong>Artificial intelligence and machine learning</strong> are dynamic frontiers of computer science and engineering. Researchers are exploring algorithms, neural networks and deep learning architectures to develop intelligent systems that process natural language, make decisions autonomously and find creative solutions to problems.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Astrophysics and cosmology</strong> explore the vastness of the universe, its origin, evolution and fundamental structure, as well as phenomena such as black holes, dark matter and dark energy, seeking to understand the fundamental forces and dynamics that govern the cosmos.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Biotechnology and genetic engineering</strong> explore techniques of gene editing, synthetic biology and genetic modification to develop new treatments for diseases, increase crop yields and solve environmental problems.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Climate science and environmental sustainability</strong> focuses on understanding the Earth's complex systems, researching climate feedback mechanisms, predicting extreme weather events and assessing the impact of human activities on ecosystems.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Nanotechnology and materials science researches</strong> nanomaterials for applications in electronics, medicine, energy storage and environmental remediation, and drives innovation in areas such as nanoelectronics, nanomedicine and nanocomposites.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Neuroscience and brain mapping</strong> use advanced imaging techniques, computer modeling and neuroinformatics to map the structure and function of the brain, decode neural circuits and develop treatments for neurological disorders.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Quantum mechanics and quantum computing</strong> explore the world of subatomic particles, quantum entanglement and superposition and seek to harness these phenomena for quantum computing, cryptography and communication.
                <br><br>
                <p>Philadelphia's great higher education institutions, excellent scientists and outstanding funding make the city one of the centers best prepared to push the boundaries of science in all these areas. Add to this a colorful past of significant contributions to science, such as the work of Benjamin Franklin. The city's museums, libraries and historic sites honor these achievements and inspire future generations of scientists and innovators. That's why we believe there could hardly be a better place than Philadelphia for the second conference in the John von Neumann Series of Pure and Applied Sciences, entitled Exploring the Frontiers of Sciences, Learning from the Past, Sharing for the Future.</p>

Through his work, Dániel shines a new light on innateness, finding that there is sufficient information in neuronal development to precisely wire every cell and every connection, even in the human brain. Dániel has driven this point home in his most recent paper, where he showed that the behavioral repertoire of a zebrafish can emerge even when the animal has had no brain activity, and thus had no opportunity to learn, for its entire life. Dániel received his B.S. in Physics from the University of Notre Dame in 2017, where he worked on network models of brain connectivity, and was awarded a PhD in Biophysics from Harvard in 2023. Dániel is currently funded by a New Science Fellowship. Outside of research, Dániel is an artist and a community builder. In 2023, along with Balázs Csizik, he exhibited "Biophilia," reflecting on the parallels between biological and urban growth.  </p>

She is intending to spend this upcoming summer studying the links between cognition and decision making in behavioral, computational and physiological terms. Her current research interests include natural language processing and the development of biomedical imaging techniques. Originally from Szeged, Hungary, Rebeka is hoping that she can help more students from home navigate the American University system, as she too benefited from being part of the Sutton Trust Fulbright Program. She also trained to be an EMT, loves playing the violin with her cellist brother, and in her spare time took up sailing and fencing at Columbia.</p>

My goal is to promote individuals to bring Science, Culture and Business from Hungary to Pennsylvania. I enjoy educating my children and grandchildren with the culture of their heritage. I also promote the beauty and history of the City of Philadelphia to Hungary and the European Union. I am inspired by the Hungarian-Americans that have accomplished so much for the city that I serve: from Eugene Ormandy conducting the Philadelphia Orchestra; our recent Nobel Laureate Dr. Katalin Kariko; her daughter, two-time Olympic Gold Champion in Women's Rowing; and the athletic achievements of Daniel Gazdag with the Philadelphia Union. </p>

Dr. Katalin Susztak has made fundamental discoveries in defining the mechanisms of kidney disease with the potential to develop new, targeted therapies. She not only mapped the genetic architecture of kidney function, but also pioneered kidney tissue banking and the integration of single cell omics datasets for a deeper mechanistic understanding. Combining human genetics with state-of-the-art transcriptomic, epigenomic and single cell analyses, Susztak has identified nearly a dozen new kidney disease risk genes and established the previously unappreciated role of proximal tubule cells in kidney function regulation. Professor Susztak is member of the American Society of Clinical Investigators, American Associations of Physicians and recipient of the Osler Award of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>

                <h2>Nobel Prize</h2>
                <p>Every year, millions of people wait for the Nobel Prize winners to be announced. They are special, they do something unimaginable to solve fundamental problems, to discover something that can make humanity's life better.</p>
                <p>Nobel Laureates have made groundbreaking contributions to their respective fields over the last century. They have often pioneered new theories, developed innovative technologies or made significant discoveries that have advanced human knowledge and understanding. They have a relentless desire to explore and understand complex phenomena and often push the boundaries of existing knowledge with their research and experiments. Many of them have faced numerous challenges and setbacks in their pursuit of excellence. However, they show remarkable perseverance in the face of adversity and are not discouraged by failures or obstacles in their path.</p>
                <p>While the Nobel Prize often recognizes the genius of the individual, collaboration and effective communication are also crucial aspects of scientific and academic success. Many laureates have collaborated with colleagues, shared ideas and disseminated their findings through publications, conferences and public lectures. With their discoveries and innovations, they address pressing problems, improve human welfare or revolutionize entire fields, leaving a lasting legacy that extends far beyond their own lifetimes. They value honesty, integrity and transparency in their dealings with colleagues, peers and the public, and adhere to the principles of scientific integrity and academic rigor.</p>
                <p>Overall, Nobel Laureates are characterized not only by their intellectual brilliance and scientific achievements, but also by their resilience, curiosity, collaborative spirit and commitment to advancing knowledge for the benefit of humanity. They are people who should be role models for the younger generation. If we can contribute to this goal with our modest means, then we will have achieved our goal. Two outstanding scientists and Nobel Prize winners are also taking part in this conference. In this way, we can encourage the younger and older generations to pursue their goals and learn from those who have dedicated their lives to the betterment of humanity.</p>
