                <h2 align="center">Visionary Scientists</h2>
                <h4 class="text-center"></h4>
                <p>We are excited to announce that the third edition of the Neumann Series will take place in the fall of 2024. 
                    The conference, titled Visionaries of the Future: Celebrating Mathematics, Science, and the Art of Strategic Play, 
                    will be held on October 11 at Liberty Science Center. This event celebrates the profound contributions of visionary 
                    scientists whose groundbreaking ideas have shaped the fields of mathematics, artificial intelligence, game theory, and beyond. 
                    Each edition of the Neumann Series focuses on a unique theme, and for this year‚Äôs event, we aim to accomplish several 
                    interconnected goals.</p>
                <p><strong>John von Neumann‚Äôs Legacy with the Art of Play</strong>
                </p>
                <p>This year‚Äôs conference highlights von Neumann‚Äôs lasting influence in mathematics and game theory, emphasizing the connection between 
                    science and play. We believe that strategic games are powerful tools for engaging the younger generation in scientific discovery.</p>
                <p><strong>The Role of Play in Science Education</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Games and science are inherently linked. Creative games, many of which are rooted in mathematics, play a crucial role in 
                    educating children and introducing them to the wonders of science‚Äîan area in which von Neumann was undoubtedly a pioneer.
                <p><strong>Commemorating 30 Years of John Charles Harsanyi‚Äôs Nobel Prize</strong></p>
                <p>This year marks the 30th anniversary of Hungarian-born economist John Charles Harsanyi‚Äôs Nobel Prize, awarded alongside 
                    John F. Nash and Reinhard Selten for their groundbreaking work in game theory. John von Neumann, together with Oscar Morgenstern, 
                    founded modern game theory, a field popularized in culture by the film A Beautiful Mind about Nash. Interestingly, Harsanyi also appears in the film!
                <p><strong>Celebrating Hungarian Nobel Laureates</strong></p>
                <p>The year 1994 was remarkable for Hungarian American scientists, as George Andrew Olah received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 
                    the same year Harsanyi won the Nobel for Economics. It‚Äôs worth noting that John von Neumann, a key figure in both fields, 
                    earned his first degree in chemical engineering before his doctorate in mathematics.
                <p><strong>Chess as a Tool for Logical and Mathematical Thinking</strong></p>
                <p>Chess, one of the most powerful tools for developing logical thinking and mathematical skills, 
                    will be a central focus of this year's event. We are honored to host a panel discussion featuring Judit Polgar, 
                    widely regarded as the greatest female chess player in history. Polgar broke countless barriers throughout her career, 
                    achieving the title of Grandmaster at the age of 15‚Äîat the time, the youngest ever to do so. She has consistently ranked
                     among the world‚Äôs top players, defeating 11 world champions, including Garry Kasparov and Magnus Carlsen, and has been a 
                     strong advocate for the educational benefits of chess.
                     <p>
                        Joining her in the discussion will be Paul Hoffman, a renowned author, science writer, and the current president and CEO of Liberty
                        Science Center. Hoffman‚Äôs works span a variety of intellectual topics, from mathematics to puzzles and strategy. He is the author of King‚Äôs 
                        Gambit: A Son, a Father, and the World‚Äôs Most Dangerous Game, an exploration of the psychological intensity and emotional complexity behind
                        chess. He is also the author of the award-winning international bestseller <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Loved-Only-Numbers/dp/0786884061/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1F6CUUZXMSVJ2&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ejZ1cNg8hE3bWOWD42wdyeTH9KqffP1zFQVM2SYfD75liFUnbsWusOUx4VxW5h_0RMuBsb0lwJci-YyJlOMapxKnC81PgNfF6pfpqfhIQanWmrAlc1HSeZ1tESXv4tBVHnGlGfCUef0an_zJ4fzUY8xea_YK1kkQbFjscWYyL2zEW-W4GliEUgDlqsESGFVMOQbb0542CrkofOt16p5uKIZVui9bLeVd6V9lvUJpZhs.Whv0HA4lqvtRW9g14wM28HBGa8F8k0uiFzaBB265Jec&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Man+Who+Love+Only+Numbers&qid=1725967058&sprefix=the+man+who+love+only+numbers%2Caps%2C225&sr=8-1" target="_blank">The Man Who Loved Only Numbers: The Story of Paul Erd≈ës and the Search for Mathematical Truth</a>. As a leader at Liberty Science Center, Hoffman continues to inspire curiosity and a love for science, education, and strategic 
                        thinking. Together, they will explore how chess and strategic play can foster critical thinking and problem-solving in the next generation.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the Rubik‚Äôs Cube</strong></p>
                <p>This year also marks the 50th anniversary of the Rubik‚Äôs Cube, the most iconic puzzle in history. The cube serves as a brilliant case study in combinatorial mathematics and problem-solving.</p>
                <p>The Liberty Science Center provides the perfect venue for this celebration, aligning with its mission to inspire future scientists and engineers and to engage learners of all ages in the joy and promise of science and technology. Each year, more than 750,000 students, teachers, and parents visit Liberty Science Center, and thousands more participate in off-site and online programs.</p>
                <p>During the event, in addition to the scientific conference, interactive games will be presented outside the conference hall. Visitors will have the chance to explore chess, the Rubik‚Äôs Cube, and other innovative games that blend education and entertainment. We believe this occasion will not only celebrate the contributions of visionary scientists but also inspire people of all ages to dive into the fascinating world of science and strategic play. Through this, we hope to contribute to the popularization of STEM education, showcasing both new and time-tested tools for learning and discovery.</p>

He was a fellow at the Alfr√©d R√©nyi Institute of Mathematics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in Budapest and from 1986 Professor of Computer Science at Rutgers University. Many of his discoveries bear his name. One of the most important is the Szemer√©di theorem, which proves a conjecture made by Erd≈ës and Paul Tur√°n in 1936. It shows that there are arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions in any set of integers with positive density. An important step in this proof, now known as Szemer√©di's Regularity Lemma, is a structural classification of large graphs. His work also found many applications in computer science, especially his collaboration with computer scientist Mikl√≥s Ajtai and mathematician J√°nos Koml√≥s on sorting. In 1983, the trio developed the Ajtai-Koml√≥s-Szemer√©di (AKS) sorting network, an algorithm that sorts n objects in a certain order in log n time steps, i.e. in the theoretically shortest possible time.</p>

                    <p>Thirty years ago, in 1994, two Hungarian-born scientists received their Nobel Prizes in the United States.
                        John C. Harsanyi received the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on game theory and its application to economics. He showed how games with incomplete information can be analyzed and thus provided the theoretical basis for a vibrant field of research ‚Äì information economics. He is also known for his research on utilitarian ethics and is considered one of the most important representatives of ‚Äúrule utilitarianism‚Äù.
                        George Andrew Olah was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his contribution to carbocation chemistry. Chemical reactions in which molecules of atoms collide and form new compounds are among the fundamental processes of nature. Carbocations are electrically charged molecules in which the charge is concentrated on a carbon atom. They play an important role as intermediates in chemical reactions and have a very short lifespan. In the early 1960s, George Olah used very strong acids to generate carbocations in solution with lifetimes long enough to study them
                        With this conference and the side events we would like to honor their achievements and provide information about their work and scientific legacy on this page.
